      Welcome to the Violin Diffusion project! This research focuses on synthesizing expressive violin performances through advanced neural synthesis techniques.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      Synthesizing expressive violin performances is a complex task due to the need for intricate pitch variations, such as vibrato and glissando, which are often missing in standard MIDI data. To address this, we introduce a two-stage neural synthesis framework. The first stage, <strong>DiffBend</strong>, estimates the missing pitch bend information, while the second stage, <strong>DiffSynth</strong>, generates high-fidelity audio incorporating these expressive details. Our method is evaluated using Fr√©chet Audio Distance (FAD) and vibrato-specific metrics, demonstrating superior performance in both audio quality and expressiveness compared to existing methods.
