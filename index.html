    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p class="message">
      Synthesizing expressive violin performances is a complex task due to the need for intricate pitch variations, such as vibrato and glissando, which are often missing in standard MIDI data. To address this, we introduce a two-stage neural synthesis framework. The first stage, DiffBend, estimates the missing pitch bend information, while the second stage, DiffSynth, generates high-fidelity audio incorporating these expressive details. Our method is evaluated using Fréchet Audio Distance (FAD) and vibrato-specific metrics, demonstrating superior performance in both audio quality and expressiveness compared to existing methods. This highlights the critical role of accurate pitch bend modeling in improving the realism of synthesized violin performances.
